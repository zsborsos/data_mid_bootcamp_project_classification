### Purpose
This repository contains files for the Mid-bootcamp project of the Part-time data analytics bootcamp at IronHack Berlin from November 2021 - May 2022. 

### Project summary
Based on a dataset of 18,000 bank customers, build a model that provides insight into which customer accepts a credit card offer and which customer declines. Expected steps are 1. Data exploration, 2. Model building and 3. Visualization.
A more detailed description of the exercise and expected outcomes can be found in the "instructions" folder.

### Methodology
For building the Machine Learning model for this classification problem, I used logistic regression and K-Nearest Neighbors. Due to the imbalanced nature of the dataset I ran the models using oversampling and under sampling techniques.
